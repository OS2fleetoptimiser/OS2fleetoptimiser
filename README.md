# OS2 FleetOptimiser

[Danish readme](README_da.md)

FleetOptimiser is a system for optimising the composition of vehicles in a fleet with the purpose to reduce cost and emission of operating the fleet.

It provides the possibility to simulate on historical data from fleet management systems through manual - and automated simulations.
In the manual simulation, one can control the number of vehicles in the fleet, whereas the automated simulation will provide an optimal fleet composition. 
There is a list of modules available to load and aggregate driving data - they all integrate to fleet management systems, load data, collects GPS logs to aggregated roundtrips and saves the aggregated data.

In addition to the possibility to simulate on fleets,one will find a number of dashboard which provides insights into specific fleet activity. 
One will find both _overview_ type of visualisations as well as _vehicle_ specific visualisations.
