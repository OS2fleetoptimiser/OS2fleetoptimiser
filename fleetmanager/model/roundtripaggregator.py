    Aggregates car trip data into a list of routes based on various criteria.

    This function takes a series of car trips and aggregates them into routes based on the proximity to allowed start
    locations, duration of stops, and other criteria. It returns a list of aggregated routes, each represented as a
    dictionary.

    Parameters:
        car (car_model): The car model information.
        car_trips (pd.DataFrame): A DataFrame containing car trip data.
        allowed_starts (start_locations): A list of allowed start locations.
        allowed_stop_duration (timedelta, optional): The maximum allowed stop duration between trips for them to be
            considered part of the same route. Defaults to 45 minutes. Is only enforced if roundtrip otherwise looks
            incorrectly
        allowed_trip_duration (timedelta, optional): The maximum allowed duration of a single trip. Defaults to 10 hours
        home_criteria (float | int, optional): The maximum allowed distance from an allowed start location for a trip to
            be considered starting or ending at home. Defaults to 0.2.
        distance_criteria (float | int, optional): The minimum required distance for a trip to be considered valid.
            Defaults to 0.1.
        anonymise_gps (bool, optional): If True, anonymise GPS coordinates in the output. Defaults to True.
        only_natural_aggregation (bool, optional): If True, only naturally aggregated routes (those that do not require
            additional conditions to be combined) are returned. Defaults to False.
        use_most_frequent_location (bool, optional): If True, use the most frequent location in the aggregation process.
            Defaults to False.
        pre_process (bool, optional): If True, time processing will happen within the function

    Returns:
        list[route]: A list of aggregated routes.

    Conditions and Logical Branches:
    1. Check for Empty Input: If the `car_trips` DataFrame is empty, return an empty list.

    2. Data Preprocessing: Convert start and end times to datetime objects and sort the trips by start time.
        Calculate the stop duration between trips.

    3. Initialisation: Initialise variables to store the state of the aggregation process, including lists to hold the
        current and completed routes, and variables to track the current home location and roundtrip distance.

    4. Main Loop: Iterate through the trips in `car_trips`.
        a. GPS Validity Check: Skip trips with invalid GPS coordinates.
        b. Home Location Identification: Identify if the trip starts or ends at a home location.
        c. Start New Route: If the car is at home and certain conditions are met, start a new route.
            - If the car returns to home within the allowed trip duration, consider updating the allowed trip duration.
        d. Complete Current Route: If the car returns to home and the route is long enough, complete the current route.
            - If `only_natural_aggregation` is False, split the route if it exceeds the allowed trip duration.
        e. Change of Home Location: If the car moves to a new home location and does not return home, start a new route.
        f. In-Between Trips: If allowed, account for trips that occur between natural aggregations.

    5. Route Finalisation: Convert the aggregated routes into the desired output format, anonymising GPS coordinates
        if requested.

    6. Post-processing: sanity of the roundtrips. Checks long duration trips and trips that has a low average km/h

    7. Output: Return the list of aggregated routes.
