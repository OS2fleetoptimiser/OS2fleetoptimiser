    Run goal simulation. Test what fleet would be the optimal based on a range of parameters. Fixed cars will only
    be removed if there's excess capacity in the fleet. Trips will be pulled from selected date range, location and
    current_cars. So if there are no current_cars (which is our comparison fleet) we'll have no trips. Current cars
    should be understood as the comparison fleet - those cars that are selected by the user to bring "forward" in the
    simulation. Then, the user can release vehicles based on end_leasing - if the user decide to release vehicles,
    they should not be present in the fixed_cars array.

    current_cars: the comparison fleet (trips will be pulled based of these)
    fixed_cars: cars that can only be removed in the simulation/optimisation if there's excess capacity in the fleet.
